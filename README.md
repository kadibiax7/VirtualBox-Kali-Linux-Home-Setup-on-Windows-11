<p align="center"> First, I’m going to make sure that virtualization is enabled. You need to have this option enabled.
  
  To do this:
  
- <b>Go to the task manager</b> 
  
- <b>Performance</b> 
  
- <b>CPU</b> 
  
- <b>Make sure that virtualization is enabled. </b>

NOTE: Make sure that your computer meets the minimum requirements to run Kali Linux. It depends on what you want to install, but for this example, we’re going to opt for the default desktop and the Kali Linux default packages. You need at least 2 gigs of RAM and 20 gigs of disk space. The batter.
